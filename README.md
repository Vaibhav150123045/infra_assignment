# infra_assignment

The code does the following features(only in linux)-->

1). Cleans up the desktop and organize files in Documents folder with particular folder names.
2). Provides you with the top 10 files in any directory that you provide.

Instructions-->
1). Run "python main.py" while being in the folder having the file "main.py".
2). When running, it asks for address of the directory from which you need to extract the top 10 files in terms of file sizes.
-------(REMEMBER TO PROVIDE THE CORRECT PATH FOR THE DIRECTORY YOU NEED TO PROCESS!!! ELSE CODE WONT WORK!)-------

THANK YOU :)
